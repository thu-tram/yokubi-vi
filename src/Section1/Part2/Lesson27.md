# Saying "if" and "when" with the four conditionals

The order of conditionals in Japanese states first the condition, and then the resulting action. Conditionals are one way we can connect two "A does B" type sentences in a structure like "If A does B, then C does D". Obviously, structures like "If A is B, then C does D" or any other combinations are acceptable too.

If only it were so simple that we could get by with just one conditional, it'd be really nice, but the fun part of Japanese is that there are a lot of different ways to say similar things, and conditionals are one of such cases. Unfortunately they all have different usages and nuances that are incredibly hard to explain in terms of English grammar, so you'll have to rely on intuition and exposure.

There are four main conditionals: たら, ば, と and なら. They all fall into a spectrum of "if" and "when" and sometimes even "as" (like in "As I woke up, I heard a weird sound outside"). There are actually more ways to make conditional sentences, but these are the main ones for this lesson.

As always, don't try to memorize this lesson perfectly, just learn to recognize each of the examples when you encounter them and know they roughly mean "if" or "when".

The simplest conditional we will see is the ば form which turns verbs into a condition. The conjugation is formed by changing the u at the end of a verb into an e, then adding ば. Basically, for godan verbs, you replace the u with an e, and for ichidan verbs, you add れ after the stem.

<pre>
見<b>れば</b>死ぬ
<b>If</b> you look you'll die.

お前を殺せ<b>ば</b>、すべてが終わる。
<b>If</b> I kill you, everything will end.
</pre>

ば implies that the condition is sufficient for the result to come to happen. It's a true logical "if". This can even be used for certain requests, like "If you're late, just call and I'll handle everything". However, ば doesn't imply that the condition will eventually happen, so it can't be used in things like "When you come around, come see me". In narration, it can sometimes mean "X happened, and then Y", but this non-conditional usage is fairly limited and not as common outside of literary works. 

For the ば conditional of the copula だ, we need to "expand" it into である and conjugate that instead.

<pre>
普通の人<b>であれば</b>、その命令に逆らうことはできないだろう
If he were a normal person, he surely would not be able to go against that order.
</pre>

For い adjectives we turn the い into ければ:

<pre>
良<b>ければ</b>教えてください。
If that is okay (with you), please teach me.
</pre>

たら is another conditional that in some usages is similar to ば. Unlike ば, however, it has a broader scope and nuance of sequential series of actions. It can be used to connect two events in either a purely hypothetical or strictly temporal sequence. It can be "If A happens, then B" but also "As A happened, B happened right after". To more easily make out this distinction, it's common for phrases in the hypothetical sense to use もし as an opening word to clue in the listener.

<pre>
<b>もし</b>敵がい<b>たら</b>私が斬り捨てます
<b>In the event that</b> there are enemies, I will cut them down (hypothetical)

朝起き<b>たら、</b>食堂には誰もいなかった。
<b>As I</b> woke up in the morning, there was no one in the cafeteria.
</pre>

The "as" usage of たら is common when recounting past "one off” events that happened to you, often unexpectedly.

たら and ば in the hypothetical sense can often be interchangeable. There's even regional variation where people from one area of Japan might prefer one or the other and vice versa. This is why you shouldn't ask questions like "why did this person use たら instead of ば?" Just accept it.

There is another special usage of たら, usually directly after names, in the form of ったら. This ったら has a completely different meaning and just acts as a particle that marks an exclamation of exasperation. It is not a conditional.

<pre>
もう、お父さん<b>ったら</b>、しっかりしなさい！
Come on, dad, get your shit together!
</pre>

と is used to link two events where one is a natural consequence of the other, in a strongly sequential way. This is similar to the temporal ordering of たら but rather than marking individual occurrences of events ("I did X and then...") it gets used to describe general events that happen every time ("Once you do X, then...").

<pre>
あんまり食べる<b>と</b>太りますよ
<b>If</b> you eat too much, you'll get fat
</pre>

This と is also commonly used in narration to describe a series of events that happen one after the other. In this usage, it makes it sound like the reader has no control over the events and they are just a spectator to a show where these events happen "naturally" in front of them.

<pre>
少し歩く<b>と</b>、開けた場所に出た。
<b>After</b> walking for a while, they came to an open area.
</pre>

The last conditional for this lesson is なら. なら is a strictly hypothetical conditional. It implies that the condition is assumed true in the hypothetical world where the statement takes place.
This means that when you say X なら Y, the meaning is close to something like "If we consider the case that X is true, then Y", but it doesn't sound as verbose as it does in English. It's a very common way to phrase things.

<pre>
行きたい<b>なら</b>一緒に行こう
<b>If it's the case that</b> you want to go, let's go together
</pre>

Due to this specific nuance of なら, it is the only conditional where the second clause can happen before the preceding one. と, たら, and ば cannot do this.

<pre>
運転する<b>なら</b>飲まないで
<b>If</b> you <b>will be</b> driving, do not drink.
</pre>

The act of 飲む would have to happen before the condition of 運転する, hence the speaker **assumes** 運転する will happen in the hypothetical world where the advice (飲まないで) takes place.

Sometimes なら can show up as ならば. The meaning is the same, but it feels more literary.

With verbs and い adjectives, の can sometimes be placed between the verb and なら. This can give some additional nuance (similar to the explanatory の in のだ) but you don't have to remember this. Just remember that the version with の can sound more literary and formal.

<pre>
そんなに知りたい<b>のなら</b>、教えてあげましょう。
<b>Since</b> you want to know so badly, I shall tell you.

そんなに知りたい<b>なら</b>教えてやる。
<b>Since</b> you want to know so badly, I'll tell you
</pre>
