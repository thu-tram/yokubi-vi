# Negated verbs

When you want to turn an ichidan verb into a negative verb, you just cut off the る at the end of the simple tense and add ない.

For godan verbs, you turn the ending "u" sound into an "a" sound, with one exception.

These examples are for illustration. You should not memorize them, just understand them for now and move on.

Ichidan: Drop る, add ない

| Plain | Negative |
|-------|----------|
|見る   | 見ない   | 
|食べる | 食べない |

Godan: Replace "u" with "a", then add ない

| Plain | Negative |
|-------|----------|
|殺**す** | 殺**さ**ない| 
|切**る** | 切**ら**ない| 
|書**く** | 書**か**ない| 
|買**う** | 買**わ**ない| 

For godan verbs ending in う, the negative uses わない, not あない. This is that one exception mentioned earlier.
