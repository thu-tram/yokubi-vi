# Possession and attributes with の

の is a particle. It's a possessive marker and an attributive marker. "Attributive" here means that something is an attribute of something else, like an attribute in a video game, like the "flame" in "flame sword". The relationship is always straightforward.

<pre>
私<b>の</b>ネコ
My cat

君<b>の</b>X
Your X.

ネコ<b>の</b>先
Ahead of the cat

男<b>の</b>子
Boy (metaphorically, male child)
</pre>

If you get lost, the easiest way to remember の is: It's like "of", but it applies backwards.

<pre>
夜<b>の</b>人
Person of the night
</pre>

Sometimes "of" gets confusing, and you have to remember the idea of "attribute".

<pre>
夜<b>の</b>海   
The night sea

海<b>の</b>夜   
Night on the sea (NOT "night of the sea")
</pre>

の is literally the single most common word in all of japanese, so make sure you remember it well!

<pre>
彼女<b>の</b>子供<b>の</b>名前だ。
It is her child's name.
</pre>
