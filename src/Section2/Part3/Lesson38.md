# Concurrence with ながら, あいだ, うちに, and つつ

This lesson focuses on how to state that something happens while something else is going on. 

ながら states that two actions are concurrently true as they happen at the same time. The subject of the two actions **must** be the same. Like "I watch TV while eating chips" is okay, but "I watch TV while my brother plays video games" is not. ながら attaches to the masu stem of the verb.

ながら is in the form of AながらB, where the action described by B is the "primary" action and the action described by A is a "secondary" action that is done at the same time. In English this nuance does not easily show up, so let's look at two examples instead:

<pre>
画面を見<b>ながら</b>勉強しよう
Let's study <b>while</b> looking at the screen.

そこで勉強し<b>ながら</b>、爺ちゃんの帰りを待つ
I waited for grandpa to come home <b>while</b> studying there
</pre>

In the first first example, the main action is to study and that is what the speaker wants to do, while in the second example the speaker is focused on the action of waiting, and while doing so they study.

つつ is another auxiliary that can be used more or less the same as ながら, except it sounds more formal and is almost only relegated to literary sentences. 

<pre>
彼女はそう言い<b>つつ</b>、苦笑いを浮かべる。
<b>While</b> she was saying that, she showed a bitter smile.
</pre>

つつある is a special usage of つつ that implies an action is happening continuously, like a more formal ている. 

<pre>
時代は変わり<b>つつあります</b>。  
The ages are continuously changing.
</pre>

However, unlike ている it cannot be used for verbs that describe states to mean "to be in a state of":

<pre>
男はもう死に<b>つつある</b>。
The man was already <b>dying</b>.

男はもう、死ん<b>でいる</b>。
The man was already <b>dead</b>.
</pre>

間/あいだ(に) and うちに are two other ways to state that something happens while something else is happening, however the usage is more general and they have a broader scope than ながら and つつ.

間/あいだ says that two events cover the same exact interval of time, **in its entirety**. This places constraints on what sorts of statements it accepts. 間 itself acts like a noun.

<pre>
二人がお風呂に入っている<b>間</b>、僕は色々考えた。
<b>While</b> those two were in the bath, I thought about a lot of stuff.
</pre>

A間**に**B says that B starts and ends **within** the span of time when A takes place. Unlike the 間 version without に, it implies that the duration of B is shorter than the duration of A, as it needs to be completely contained within A's interval.

<pre>
俺が意識を失っている<b>間に</b>何があったのだろうか？
I wonder what happened <b>while</b> I was out unconscious? 
</pre>

うちに says that an event happens while the statement before うちに remains true.

<pre>
そんな事を考えている<b>うちに</b>、完全に日が沈んでしまった。
<b>While</b> I was thinking about that stuff, the sun set completely. 
</pre>

It often has a nuance that the event marked by うちに is limited in time and will eventually finish. 

<pre>
蜘蛛がいない<b>うちに</b>救出するか
Are you going to rescue them <b>while</b> the spiders are away?
</pre>

This is often used to give recommendations or suggestions like "before X happens, we should do Y".

<pre>
冷めない<b>うちに</b>食べましょう。
Let's eat <b>before</b> it gets cold. (lit. let's eat while it is not cold)
</pre>
