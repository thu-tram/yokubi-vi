# Comparing things with より and の方が

より is used to compare two things in a direct way, like the "than" in "I'm smarter than you". When you use より, you do not need to use a "more" word, unlike English which needs to say "**more** X than Y" or "X**er** than Y". Sometimes より can be followed by も for emphasis.

<pre>
彼は誰<b>より</b>も強いよ
He is stronger <b>than</b> anyone
</pre>

In this given example, 誰より without も can come across as weird and is less common.

より is also used in constructions about relative position (in space or time), similar to から. 

<pre>
南<b>より</b>迫る
To approach <b>from</b> the south

新世界<b>より</b>
<b>From</b> the New World
</pre>

This usage of より is common in written letters, where より marks the sender and へ the recipient.

If you want to list both sides of a comparison, you mark the lower bound with より and the upper bound with 方. 方 is a noun that reads ほう in this usage (don't be tricked by the かた reading!), and as with every noun, it attaches to other nouns with の and can take particles after it. In case of a comparison, the 方 "side" is usually marked by が whether or not it is the subject of the action.

<pre>
メリット<b>より</b>もデメリット<b>の方が</b>大きい
The cons are bigg<b>er</b> than the pros.
</pre>

The より side can be dropped if implied.

<pre>
私は一人で行動する<b>方が</b>性に合っている。
It is <b>more</b> natural for me to act on my own.
</pre>

Literally, this 方 usage marks a "side" of the comparison. XよりYの方がZ can be understood as "starting **from** the X side, the Y side is **more** Z" where X is the lower bound and Y the upper.

There are a few idiomatic expressions that make use of 方が.

\<verb\>方がいい means "it is better to do \<verb\>". It is common in this construction to use the verb in past tense if the statement comes from a position of personal advice rather than a general truth.

<pre>
やめ<b>た方がいい</b>と思います
I think <b>it'd be better</b> for you to stop.

少し余裕があ<b>る方がいい</b>だろう。
<b>It's better</b> to have a bit of extra leeway I guess.
</pre>

When いい is conjugated in past tense like 方がよかった it implies some regret or reprimand about an action that should or shouldn't have been done in the past.

<pre>
真面目に戦っ<b>た方がよかった</b>のだろうか。
Would it <b>have been better</b> if I had fought seriously?
</pre>
