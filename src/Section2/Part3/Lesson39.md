# Reasoning with から そして ので で

から is not just the case particle "from". It also shows up as a conjunction, used to connect two sentences, where the thing after から is the outcome or result of the thing before から. 

You can differentiate the conjuction から from the case particle から because the particle only comes after nouns and the conjunction after completed clauses. This means to attach the "because of" から to nouns and な adjectives, you must add だ (or です). It also can go directly after verbs and い adjectives (which the particle から cannot do).

A(だ)からB roughly means "It is B, because of A".

<pre>
暑い<b>から</b>プールに行きたいです
It's hot<b>, so</b> I want to go to the pool

みんないい人<b>だから</b>、きっと気にいる
They are all good people<b>, so</b> I'm sure you'll like them.
</pre>

から can come at the beginning of a sentence in the form of だから. In this usage it can either be emphasis, or give an explanation for a previous statement.

<pre>
<b>だから、</b>そんなこと言わないでください。
<b>I'm telling you,</b> please don't say that!
</pre>

ので acts like から. After nouns and な adjectives it becomes なので or ですので. 

There are some nuance differences between から and ので but the gist is that から sounds more like a subjective opinion and ので feels more objective. For this reason, in polite contexts から can come across as pushy and ので is often preferred.

<pre>
外は暑い<b>ので</b>気をつけてください
It's hot outside, <b>so</b> please be careful.

大事なこと<b>なので</b>、二回言いました。
It was an important thing<b>, so</b> I said it twice.
</pre>

で can be used as a conjunction similar to "so". It establishes a weak cause \-\> effect relationship. で goes after nouns and な adjectives. For verbs and い adjectives they get conjugated in て form to achieve the same result. 

<pre>
突然のこと<b>で、</b>すぐに理解できなかった
It was sudden<b>, so</b> I couldn't immediately understand it.
</pre>

This usage of で can also show up at the beginning of a statement to continue a previous statement, sometimes as それで:

<pre>
<b>それで、</b>これからどうするの？  
<b>So,</b> what are you going to do next?
</pre>

そして is an interjection that essentially gives a sense of finality as the last element in a list of sequential statements (like "and in the end...") or a conclusive reason ("and so..."). It can sound formal.

<pre>
<b>そして、</b>ついにその日が来た。
<b>And in the end,</b> that day finally came.

<b>そして、</b>ありがとうございました。
<b>And so,</b> thank you.
</pre>
