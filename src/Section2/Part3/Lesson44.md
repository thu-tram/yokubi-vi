# Wrongness with だめ, いけない, ならない, and how to say "must"

だめ is a word that means something like "no good", "useless", or "no use". It can be used to say that a statement would be bad, after connecting that previous statement with ては or conditionals like たら, etc.

<pre>
あまり迷惑をかけ<b>てはダメ</b>ですよ。  
Inconveniencing others too much <b>is not good</b>. (lit: "if you inconvenience others too much, it is not good")

日本だっ<b>たらダメ</b>なんだろうけど、ここでは大丈夫みたい。  
Had it been Japan it <b>would've been bad</b>, but here it seems fine.
</pre>

ならない and いけない are similar to だめ, but they feel stronger and have an implication that something is prohibited, either by someone's decision or social expectations.

<pre>
他人のものを、盗ん<b>ではならない</b>。
Stealing other people's stuff <b>is unacceptable</b>. (lit: "it is unbecoming")
</pre>

All three of these "not good" groups (だめ, ならない, いけない) are often used with a negative conditional statement (〜なければならない, 〜なくてはいけない, 〜ないとダメ, and any other similar combination) to convey a meaning of "must do". Since Aてはならない means "must not do A", then logically (not A)てはならない means "must not *not* do A" hence "must do A".

This is how you say "must do X" or "have to do X" in Japanese. It sounds like a mouthful, but you'll get used to it in no time.

<pre>
やら<b>なければならない</b>ことはたくさんある。
There are a lot of things <b>I must do</b>. (lit: "things that if I don't do it won't be acceptable")
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Style-wise, the combination of 〜ないと + ならない is seen as poor form and some people will consider it incorrect. You will come across it relatively often even in books, but it's advisable to avoid using it and instead opt for 〜ないといけない.
</div>

なければ is commonly contracted to なきゃ and ては is commonly contracted to ちゃ (では is じゃ).

<pre>
死ん<b>じゃ</b>ダメ！
You <b>must</b> not die! (lit: "dying is not good")
</pre>

When implied by context, at the end of a statement, the part after the conditional is regularly dropped because these expressions are so incredibly common that everyone understands what comes after anyway.

<pre>
冷めないうちに食べ<b>ないと</b>。
You <b>must</b> eat before it gets cold.
</pre>
