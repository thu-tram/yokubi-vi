# A bit more: Some extra particles and auxiliaries

As a final lesson, let's talk about a last few particles and auxiliaries that couldn't fit into any of the other lessons.

Most of these are listing particles or emphatic particles that are hard to forget and easy to get a feel for. Consider them a final parting gift of knowledge.

なり can be a list marker that marks examples of possible options.

<pre>
親<b>なり</b>教師<b>なり</b>の指導が必要だ
The guidance of a parent or a teacher is important.
</pre>

きり/っきり is an auxiliary suffix with three meanings.
- In the pattern \<noun\>きり, it acts like an "only" marker.
- In the pattern \<statement\>きり, it basically means "ever since \<statement\>".
- In the pattern \<verb stem\>きり, it can mean "to do \<verb\> to completion".

やら is a particle with two meanings. It can be used at the end of a question like か but with a nuance of uncertainty and emotional emphasis.

<pre>
まったく、何を考えているの<b>やら</b>。
Seriously, what are they even thinking...?
</pre>

It can also be used to list possibilities/examples, like か for alternatives.

<pre>
夢の中ならお茶<b>やら</b>お菓子<b>やら</b>出せます。
If it's inside a dream, I can serve things like tea and sweets.
</pre>

こそ is an emphatic particle that acts a lot like stressing the word in english. In other words, it literally emphasizes whatever it attaches to. It often goes "on top" of other particles like が, は, を, etc and hides them.

<pre>
こういう時<b>こそ</b>冷静にならないと
It is <b>precisely</b> at times like these I must keep cool.
</pre>

さえ is an emphatic particle that means "even an X", "only an X", or "as long as X", depending on the phrase. 

<pre>
私<b>さえ</b>いなければ、こんなことにはならなかった。
If <b>only</b> I hadn't been there, this wouldn't have happened.

これ<b>さえ</b>あればなんとかなるだろう。
<b>As long as</b> we have this, it will somehow work out.
</pre>

すら is a slightly literary emphatic particle very similar to さえ. すら can replace さえ when さえ means "even an X".

<pre>
何が起きたのか<b>すら</b>理解できなかった。
I couldn't <b>even</b> understand what had happened.
</pre>

ずつ is a particle that means "each" or "at a time". It emphasizes that the pace of something is steady.

<pre>
ゆっくり、ゆっくりと、一歩<b>ずつ</b>。
Slowly... Slowly... one step <b>at a time</b>.
</pre>

がる is an auxiliary verb that means that someone other than the speaker shows signs of something. たがる is a combination of たい and がる, meaning someone looks like they want to do something.

<pre>
彼女はそれを知り<b>たがって</b>いた。
She looked like she wanted to know.
</pre>

がち is an auxiliary verb that means that someone or something has a tendency. The tendency is often undesirable from an outside view.

<pre>
後ろから、遠慮<b>がち</b>に声が掛けられた。
I was called hesitantly by a voice from behind.
</pre>
