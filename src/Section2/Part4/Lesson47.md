# Still, already, and yet with もう, まだ, and また

With positive statements, もう expresses "already". With negative statements, it works together with the negation to express "not anymore".

Basically, もう means that there's a change of state from the statement being false or irrelevant to the statement being true: "already" and "not anymore".

<pre>
<b>もう</b>こんな時間だ
It's this late! (lit. It's already this time)

<b>もう</b>食べたよ
I already ate

<b>もう</b>食べないの？
You won't eat anymore?
</pre>

もう can also appear as an emphatic expression of frustration

<pre>
<b>もう</b>いいよ
I've had enough (lit. it's already at a sufficient level)

<b>もう</b>！
(angry frustrated noises)
</pre>

In statements about the near future, もう can mean "soon" instead. This usually goes along with an adverb expressing soonness, but sometimes it's just implied.

<pre>
どうやら<b>もう</b>来るみたい
Well it seems like he'll arrive soon
</pre>

Another use of もう expresses "more" of an amount.

<pre>
<b>もう</b>一杯！
One more drink!

<b>もう</b>ちょっと
A bit more
</pre>

まだ expresses the idea of "still" or "yet" and it is the opposite of もう. It's used when a state stays the same.

<pre>
<b>まだ</b>食べるの？
Are you still going to eat (more)? / Are you going to continue eating?

<b>まだ</b>負けないな！
I haven't lost yet!

<b>まだまだ</b>
Not yet!
</pre>

まだまだ is an adverb and set expression that also works as a more emphatic まだ

<div class="warning">
Cultural note: if someone says your Japanese is good, you answer まだまだ because you still have a long way to go.
</div>

もう is used for "yet" in positive questions, since もう highlights a change.

<pre>
<b>もう</b>書きましたか？
Did you write it yet?

<b>もう</b>眠いの？
Are you already sleepy?
</pre>

また expresses the idea of "again".

<pre>
<b>また</b>来た
He came again.

<b>また</b>来ないな
Looks like he's not coming again.
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Try not to confuse また with まだ (you will 100% confuse また with まだ).
</div>
